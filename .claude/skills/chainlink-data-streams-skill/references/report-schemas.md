# Report Schemas

Use this file when the user asks to decode reports, understand schema properties, choose a schema, or check whether a stream is available or deprecated.

## Source Of Truth

Schema versions are stable once published; Chainlink can add new schema versions over time. Keep the local catalog below as the offline fallback, but verify current availability, deprecation, SDK package versions, and stream entitlement from:

- `https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/reference/report-schema-overview.md`
- `https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/deprecating-streams.md`
- `https://github.com/smartcontractkit/data-streams-sdk`

This local catalog was derived from the official Go SDK report packages in `github.com/smartcontractkit/data-streams-sdk/go@v1.2.4`, which exposes decoders for v1 through v13. TypeScript docs also describe automatic report decoding through v13.

## Common Fields

These fields appear across many schema versions:

| Field | ABI type | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `feedId` | `bytes32` | Stream identifier. The feed ID also encodes the report schema version used by SDK decoders. |
| `validFromTimestamp` | `uint32` | Earliest Unix timestamp, in seconds, from which the report is valid. |
| `observationsTimestamp` | `uint32` | Unix timestamp, in seconds, for the DON observation/consensus time. |
| `nativeFee` | `uint192` | Native-token verification fee value used by onchain verification flows. |
| `linkFee` | `uint192` | LINK-denominated verification fee value used by onchain verification flows. |
| `expiresAt` | `uint32` | Unix timestamp, in seconds, after which the report should be treated as expired. |
| `marketStatus` | `uint32` | Market state signal. Interpret through current docs/SDK constants before using in risk logic. |
| `ripcord` | `uint32` | Issuer/source risk flag. When active, consumers should not treat the value as normal market data. |

Treat `int192` and `uint192` values as large fixed-point/integer values. Do not convert through floating point in generated code.

## Decoding Rules

1. Identify the schema version from the feed ID/report metadata or SDK decoder type.
2. Use the official SDK decoder for the target language whenever available.
3. Preserve the raw full report alongside decoded fields when storing data.
4. Treat numeric values as fixed-point or large integer values until the docs confirm scaling and display units.
5. Do not assume every schema has `price`, `bid`, and `ask`.
6. Explain `marketStatus`, `ripcord`, timestamp, and corporate-action fields as application-level risk signals, not generic fields to ignore.

## Response Shape For Schema Questions

For "what schemas exist?" answer with:

1. official source checked, or say that live verification failed
2. schema version and stream category where known
3. purpose
4. field list with ABI types
5. whether current/deprecated status was verified
6. any SDK decoder caveats

For "decode this report" answer with:

1. target language and SDK decoder path
2. schema version used
3. decoded fields
4. raw report preservation recommendation
5. verification warning if the user plans to use the report in value-securing logic

## Deprecation Guidance

Do not guess deprecation status. If docs cannot be fetched, say:

```text
I could not verify the current Data Streams deprecation page: <URL>. I can explain schema field definitions from the local skill reference, but you should confirm current availability before shipping.
```
