# Official Sources

Use this file when the answer depends on current Data Streams facts such as available schemas, deprecated streams, endpoints, SDK APIs, verifier addresses, or supported networks.

## Freshness Policy

1. Do not hardcode live Data Streams facts such as current feed IDs, endpoint availability, schema deprecation status, verifier addresses, supported networks, or SDK method names.
2. Re-check official sources whenever the user needs a current feed, current schema status, current endpoint, current SDK behavior, or current verifier deployment.
3. Distinguish stable concepts from live configuration data.
4. If a live source conflicts with cached assumptions, prefer the live source and say so.
5. Cite the exact official source used for freshness-sensitive answers.

Local fallback:
- `references/public-endpoints-and-addresses.md`

Use for:
- REST endpoints for latest reports, timestamp lookups, bulk report queries, and paginated report history

- `https://github.com/smartcontractkit/data-streams-sdk/tree/main/typescript`

Use for:
- official Go, Rust, and TypeScript SDK APIs
- examples for fetching, decoding, streaming, HA mode, and metrics
- package names and language-specific setup

### Onchain Verification

URLs:
- `https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/reference/data-streams-api/onchain-verification.md`
- `https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/tutorials/evm-onchain-report-verification.md`
- `https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/supported-networks.md`
- `https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation/blob/main/src/features/feeds/data/StreamsNetworksData.ts`
- `https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/tutorials/solana-onchain-report-verification.md`
- `https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/tutorials/solana-offchain-report-verification.md`
- `https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/tutorials/stellar-onchain-report-verification.md`

Local fallback:
- `references/public-endpoints-and-addresses.md`

Use for:
- verifier interfaces and current addresses
- EVM, Solana, and Stellar verification flows
- code generation and review for verification contracts/programs
- local public verifier address fallbacks when docs fetching is unavailable

### Chainlink Local For Data Streams Tests

URLs:
- `https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local`
- `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/local`
- `https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-local/releases`

Use for:
- local Foundry, Hardhat, or Remix tests that mock Data Streams verification
- `DataStreamsLocalSimulator.sol`, `MockReportGenerator.sol`, `MockVerifierProxy.sol`, and related package APIs
- package-source examples that are not yet reflected in the official Data Streams docs

Re-check package version and source files before relying on newly added simulator APIs. Known package-sourced Data Streams mock support includes `DataStreamsLocalSimulator`, `DataStreamsLocalSimulatorFork`, `MockReportGenerator`, `MockVerifier`, `MockVerifierProxy`, `MockFeeManager`, and billing-mode helpers such as `enableOffChainBilling()` and `enableOnChainBilling()`.

### Frontend and Candlestick Data

URLs:
- `https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/reference/candlestick-api.md`

Use for:
- OHLC history endpoints
- supported symbol and group discovery
- live price updates for frontend charting

### Billing

URLs:
- `https://docs.chain.link/data-streams/billing.md`
- `https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=datastreams`

Use only to redirect users to official Chainlink contact channels. Do not expose, infer, or summarize private billing details.

## Practical Selection Rules

1. For credentials or auth setup, start with the authentication page and prefer SDK-managed auth.
2. For report decoding or schema properties, start with the report schema overview, then the language SDK docs.
3. For REST latest/timestamp/history work, use the REST API docs plus the target language SDK. Use the local public endpoint table only as a fallback or default example.
4. For WebSocket or HA work, use the WebSocket docs plus the target language SDK. Use the local public endpoint table only as a fallback or default example.
5. For onchain verification, use the chain-specific verification tutorial and fetch current verifier addresses. Use the local public verifier table only as an offline fallback and tell the user to re-check before deployment or transactions.
6. For candlestick charts, use the Candlestick API docs and keep Data Streams credentials server-side.
7. For billing questions, do not speculate. Direct the user to Chainlink.

## Documentation Fetching

1. If WebFetch, a browser tool, or an MCP server can retrieve docs, use it before answering freshness-sensitive questions.
2. If Context7 (`@upstash/context7-mcp`) is available, use it as a fallback for `docs.chain.link` and SDK documentation.
3. If all fetch methods fail, explicitly tell the user which URL could not be verified and use only the embedded reference files as a floor.
